## Here is a brief write up about my first time dabbling with audio equipment
<p>
<img class="post-image left" src="/images/posts/IMG_7466.jpg" alt="bluetooth speaker"> While riding my bike home from work over this past summer, I spotted a beautiful boombox sitting on the curb. While it looked to be in ok shape, it had a note attached warning about the stereo's hunger for tapes. BUMMER! That's ok though, I figured this would make a for a fun project (and it matches my bike), so I brought it home!
